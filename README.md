Project Title: Myntra Clone

Description: Developed a Myntra-inspired e-commerce web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project replicated Myntra's user interface and key features, including product catalog, user authentication, shopping cart, and responsive design. I ensured an engaging user experience with product listings, filtering, and sorting options. Users can register, log in securely, and complete purchases with a mock payment gateway. The responsive design guarantees a seamless experience on various devices.

Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Challenges: Creating a dynamic product catalog with filtering, sorting, and user authentication while maintaining data security. Ensuring responsive design for cross-device compatibility was also a challenge.

Outcome: Demonstrated expertise in web development and UI/UX design. The project is hosted on [GitHub (provide the link)], showcasing practical skills and project management abilities.

Future Plans: Expanding the project with user reviews, wishlists, real-time chat support, and improved search functionality to further enhance the e-commerce experience.
